# SAT
Optimising Classifier for Boolean Satisfiability Problem


Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) is an NP-complete problem that has applications in many fields such as Automated Theorem Design, Security, Artificial Intelligence, Circuit Planning, and Verification. In this project, we have implemented the Boolean Satisfiability Problem using Graph Neural Networks. The focus of the project is to reduce the time taken to train the model by using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) technique in place of the Traditional Gradient Descent and Rectified Linear Unit activation function in place of the tanh function used in the base paper and compare the results. The dataset has been selected and Gradient descent, Mini batch decent, and Stochastic gradient descent have been implemented. The dataset has been spilled into a training and testing set to fit and validate the models. The accuracy score and F1 score have been evaluated of the models.
